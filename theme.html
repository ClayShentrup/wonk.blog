        so you liked the design of wonk.blog and you want to know how it was made.
        flattering. genuinely. <em>here you go.</em><br /><br />
        every color, every font, every decision is documented below with a completely
        real but also kind of unhinged backstory. because good design
        has a <strong>reason</strong>, even when the reason is "it just felt right and
        i needed to justify it after the fact."

        any resemblance to actual graphic design school curriculum is coincidental.<br />

          <p class="font-story">designed by masha cairo for google fonts, released 2022. it's named "unbounded" because the letters have no descenders and extend upward without constraint — like an argument that keeps escalating at thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />the <em>real</em> reason it's here: it looks like a font that would be on the cover of a soviet-era technical manual about optimal collective farm output allocation, but make it fashion. bauhaus meets brutalism meets "i have opinions about land value taxation."</p>
